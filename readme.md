The State of Unions


This web map shows the changes in the share of workforce unionized between 2018 – 2019,
there is data available for the change between 2019-2020 but the previous years were chosen 
because of the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic driving layoffs and many other workforce changes. 
The article in Time Magazine US Labor Unions are Having a Moment talks through examples of high profile strikes and unionizations. 
Along with a change in political support for unions, exponential increase in profits unmatched by wages and strains that were present
on the labor market during the Coronavirus pandemic. Although the pandemic has driven more labor unrest and strikes as workers faced 
unsafe working conditions. There overall has been a more present labor movement in recent years and the increase in the share the 
workforce overall in 2019 is indicative. This is the first positive change in decades. Because of this there is more news coverage 
of strikes and unions especially of well-known employers such as Amazon, Starbucks, John Deere, and Kellogg’s. Spatially, this does 
not shed light on any significant patterns, the companies mapped do happen to be concentrated in the Midwestern part of the United States. 
There would need to be more comprehensive studies to make any claims such as this.
